Well, there is no license. The project Beat Juggler will be licensed later. However, I found this file useful for some disambiguation and contact information.

Beat Juggler as a ditributed project is a set of files named by a simple scheme:

- LICENSE.md (this file)
- README.md (brief description)
- Beat Juggler Solo [version].amxd (pure solo implementation)

...

- Beat Juggler ([controller]) Master [version].amxd (controller-specific master device)
- Beat Juggler ([controller]) Track [version].amxd (controller-specific solo device)

...

- /patches/Beat Juggler Solo [version].maxpat (exported patch for the title device, and so on)

...

Exported patches are stored for diff dynamics on GitHub.
