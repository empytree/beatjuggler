Beat Juggler is a looper Max for Live device built around beat manipulating idea you might have seen in mlr and similar programs. Being bound to tempo and beat of your song in Ableton, it constantly records incoming audio to internal looped buffer, which is bars-fold length. The buffer is mapped across eight buttons, inviting you to recall selected beats with proper quantization. Playback could be stuttered and reversed. The buffer could be locked for a while, therefore providing elementary looper capabilities.

Beat Juggler introduces two implementations - Solo devices and much more powerful Controller versions (featuring Master device that conducts an orchestra of controller-specific track devices).

List of controllers covered:
- Launchpad (by Novation music)

Yep, Launchpad only for now - it's the sole grid controller I own. However, I am highly interested in creating versions for other popular grid controllers, Akai's APC40 in the first place. I need to purchase those, so I humbly asking for targeted donations. Further information obtained on project website.


Usage:

Solo version: drag file "Beat Juggler Solo 1.0b.amxd" over any track in Ableton.
Launchpad version: drag files "Beat Juggler (LP) Track 1.0b.amxd" onto tracks in Ableton, put "Beat Juggler (LP) Master 1.0b.amxd" on master track.
Or simply double-click those fancy .amxd files, press buttons with question marks and be happy.


Beat Juggler was inspired by following great projects:

- BeatLookUp (by Chris "CList" List): http://www.semaforte.com/reaktor/about.htm
Actually, I've never touched it. Once I had seen Moldover used it in his setup: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2McDeSKiOU - and I become bent on embedding similar plugin in my own Ableton setup.

- mlr (by tehn): http://monome.org/docs/app:mlr
It's a role model. No comments. Never used, tried once along with mlrv.

- Beat Indexer (by Shane Hazleton): http://www.maxforlive.com/library/device/880/beat-indexer-by-shane-hazleton-akai-professional
Similar project where I've discovered brilliant idea of master/slave devices break-up.
